# NYU's effort to scrape and analyze [Facebook's Political Ad Archive](https://www.facebook.com/politicalcontentads/)
Our team performed an initial analysis of Facebook's archive of ads with political content that primarily span eight weeks from May 2018 - July 2018. 


## Introduction
Facebook launched their searchable archive of U.S. political advertisements on May 24, 2018. We devise a data collection methodology to obtain a large set of 267,000 political ads from Facebookâ€™s political ad archive. In our paper attached below, we include our initial analysis of Facebook's political ad archive, our methodology for collecting archived political ads, and a detailed description of the database of political ads that we are releasing in conjunction with the report. 


## Facebook Political Ad Archive Overview
According to Facebook: "The archive includes Facebook and Instagram ads that have been classified as containing political content, or content about national issues of public importance." This archive provides an increased level of transparency of political ads on Facebook and Instagram.
